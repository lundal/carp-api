## Cellular Automata Research Platform - API

This repository contains the software api for my work on the Cellular Automata Reasearch Platform at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

#### How to test
1. Run make to compile test files for both 2D and 3D
2. Execute test_2d <test_number> or test_3d <test_number>

#### Requirements
* FPGA connected to PCI Express implementing the 2D or 3D carp design.
